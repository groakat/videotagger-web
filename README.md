# VideoTagger

## Summary

VideoTagger is a program that helps scientists to analyze videos. This includes fast-forwarding through videos to quickly identify if the video contains useful information, functionality to annotate stuff and to visualize annotations that span over a long period of time. Additionally, plugins allow for integration of machine learning algorithms that automate tasks.

## Explore

If confronted with a long video, extending over hours, if not weeks or months, it becomes quickly untractable to watch significant parts of the dataset. 

- VideoTagger can speed up and reverse videos up to 60x their original speed. Still, frame-by-frame stepping is possible for precise navigation through interesting frames.

- VideoTagger can concatenate shorter videos to infinitely long video sequences.

## Annotate

To quantify findings in the video, annotations are necessary.

- VideoTagger supports infinite label classes and infinite users
- Each user can customize the colour appearance of each class
- anything in the video can be tracked by following it with the mouse
- labels can be easily modified (move, resize, rename) with the mouse
- externally computed trajectories can be imported
- thumbnails of adjacent frames are shown that make it easy to see what happens in the previous and following frames
