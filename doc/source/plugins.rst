Plugins 
========== 

Target
------

Ideally we want to allow users to include plugins that are capable of getting the following information from `VideoTagger`:

    + Video files
    * Extracted Features
    * Current annotations
    * Plugins should be stand-alone if executed as Python script



We want to know whether we can test this or not.
